## Highlights of 2018
[Highlights of 2019](https://saiilc.github.io/homepage/blog.html)

**Dec. 4 (Tue.)**
* Attended the IARPA SuperTools technical exchange meeting in Annapolis, Maryland.
* Visited a friend from Germany who is an expert of Gravitational wave detection and used to work for LIGO. We had a very nice conversation and some tasty Mexican food.  

**Oct. 31 (Wed.)**
* Attended the Applied Superconductivity Conference in Seattle. I was invited to give a talk at the young scientist session. Felt quite excited considering this was the first plenary talk that I have ever given. Feedbacks were quite positive and I assume that people liked it. I further had an oral presentation regarding the recent neural network research and a poster presentation about the synthesis framework of AQFP logics.
