## Highlights of 2018
[Highlights of 2019](https://saiilc.github.io/homepage/blog.html)

**Dec. 4 (Tue.)**
* Attended the IARPA SuperTools technical exchange meeting in Annapolis, Maryland.
* Visited a friend from Germany who is an expert of Gravitational wave detection and used to work for LIGO. We had a very nice conversation and some tasty Mexican food. D.C. was quite cold, the flight back got delayed by 10 hours, tough journey.  

**Oct. 31 (Wed.)**
* Attended the Applied Superconductivity Conference in Seattle. I was invited to give a talk at the young scientist session. Felt quite excited considering this was the first plenary talk that I have ever given. Feedbacks were quite positive and I assume that people liked it. I further had an oral presentation regarding the recent neural network research and a poster presentation about the synthesis framework of AQFP logics.

**Spet. 24 (Mon)**
* Gave two lectures to the [Summer School on Superconducting Electronics 2018](http://snf.ieeecsc.org/news/summer-school-superconducting-electronics-2018) on AQFP logic circuits design, in Minorca, Spain. Excellent location, great lecturers and students, food, wine, hospitality, pretty much everything. Looking forward to visiting Minorca again.

**Aug. 27 (Mon)**
* Attended the SuperTools program meeting in USC, LA.
