## Now you are in the year 2019, be aware of it.
[Highlights of 2018](https://saiilc.github.io/homepage/blog_2018.html)

**Jan. 11 （Fri.）**
* [Prof. Karl Berggren](http://www.rle.mit.edu/people/directory/karl-berggren/) from MIT visited IAS and gave a nice talk about SSPD applications using superconducting-nanowire. I like some of his ideas/impressions of the superconductivity community.

* 1st China section exchange meeting has been held. YNU's president, vice president and 20 professors attended this meeting and had some discussions over the promotion of research and education collaboration with high-level Chinese universities. "The time for YNU to be chosen by the Chinese universities has come, to improve the level of YNU is very important."
